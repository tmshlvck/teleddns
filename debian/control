Description: Advanced DDNS client with Netlink support
 TeleDDNS is an advanced DDNS client with daemonization support (as a systemd
 service) or one-shot running capability. When running in daemon mode, it
 listens for Netlink messages and pools updates to minimize both DDNS
 convergence time and resource usage.
 .
 Features:
  - Efficient address change detection via Netlink
  - Support for both IPv4 and IPv6
  - Configurable update hooks
  - Systemd integration
